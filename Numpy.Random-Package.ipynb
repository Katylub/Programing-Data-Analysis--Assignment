    "NumPy is a module for the Python programming language that’s used for data science and scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, NumPy performs data manipulation on numerical data. It enables you to collect numeric data into a data structure, called the NumPy array. It also enables you to perform various computations and manipulations on NumPy arrays.\n",

    "If you’re doing any sort of statistics or data science in Python, you’ll often need to work with random numbers. Random samples are very common in data-related fields. This particular type of functions are used in a lot of games, lotteries or any application requiring random number generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy has a variety of tools for working with numerical data, creating random samples. In most cases, NumPy’s tools enable you to do one of two things: create numerical data (structured as a NumPy array), or perform some calculation on a NumPy array.\n",

    "If you’re working in Python and doing any sort of data work, you’ll have to create a random sample at some point. NumPy random Package can help you do just that."

    "### What is NumPy random seed?\n",
    "NumPy random seed is a function that sets the random seed of the NumPy pseudo-random number generator. It provides an essential input that enables NumPy to generate pseudo-random numbers for random processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a pseudo-random number?\n",
    "Pseudo-random numbers are computer generated numbers that appear random, but are actually predetermined. Almost random, but not really random. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computers solve the problem of generating “random” numbers with an algorithm. That is to say, the numbers generated by pseudo-random number generators appear to be random. Even though the numbers they are completely determined by the algorithm, when you examine them, there is typically no discernible pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use of seed \n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy.random.seed provides an input to the pseudo-random number generator\n",
    "\n",
    "The pseudo-random number generated by NumPy, are 100% determined by the input and the pseudo-random number algorithm provided and that is what seed function does. \n",
    "\n",
    "It allows you to provide a “seed” value to NumPy’s random number generator.\n",
    "The numpy.random.seed function works in conjunction with other functions from NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, numpy.random.seed works with other function from the numpy.random namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, you might use numpy.random.seed along with numpy.random.randint. This will enable you to create random integers with NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use numpy.random.seed with numpy.random.normal to create normally distributed numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "… or you can use it with numpy.random.choice to generate a random sample from an input.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, there are several dozen NumPy random functions that enable you to generate random numbers, random samples, and samples from specific probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy random seed is deterministic\n",
    "Remember what I said earlier in this tutorial …. pseudo-random number generators are completely deterministic. They operate by algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that if you provide the same seed, you will get the same output.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you change the seed, you will get a different output.\n",
    "\n",
    "= Essentially, we use NumPy random seed when we need to generate pseudo-random numbers in a repeatable way.\n",
    "The fact that np.random.seed makes your code repeatable also makes is easier to share.\n",
